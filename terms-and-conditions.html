      <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>You agree that: (a) your use of the Services will be deemed to have been performed in Michigan,
        regardless of where the Services are actually provided or accessed; and (b) your use of the
        Services will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us,
        either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Michigan. These Terms will be governed by
        the internal substantive laws of the State of Michigan, without respect to its conflict of laws
        principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate
        commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the
        Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement
        of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 9 (“Arbitration Agreement”) and preempts all state laws
        to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises
        from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed
        by the law of the state of Michigan. The application of the United Nations Convention on
        Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the
        exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the city of Detroit and in
        Wayne County, Michigan for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other
        equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
        infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents,
        or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in Section 9 (“Arbitration”) below,
        including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Wayne
        County, Michigan is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or
        for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be
        unenforceable.</p>

      <h2>10. Arbitration</h2>
      <p>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE
PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN
WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM BEAWARE.</p>

      <h3>10.1 Court Jurisdiction</h3>
      <p>Each party irrevocably agrees that, subject to the provisions of clause 0 below, the courts of
        Wayne County, Michigan have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising
        out of or in connection with this contract, including non-contractual disputes or claims, or any
        question regarding its existence, validity or termination (individually and collectively,
        “Dispute”).</p>
      <h3>10.2 Arbitration Option</h3>
      <p>Despite the above clause 0, the parties agree that the Company may, at its sole option (and
        regardless of whether the Company is claimant or respondent), refer a Dispute, for final
        resolution, to arbitration rather than to litigation. The arbitration shall be administered by
        American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its AAA rules which rules are deemed to be
        incorporated by reference into this clause. The number of arbitrators will be one. The seat, or
        legal place, of arbitration will be Detroit, Michigan and the language of the arbitral proceedings
        will be English. The governing law of this arbitration agreement will be the substantive law of
        Wayne County, Michigan. This clause 0 is for the benefit of BeAware. Nothing in this clause
        will affect any right either party may have to seek interim relief from a national court that is not
        available from the arbitral tribunal.</p>
      <h3>10.3 Terminating Litigation</h3>
      <p>If the Customer has already initiated court proceedings in relation to a Dispute before BeAware
        has commenced arbitration proceedings, Customer agrees that, on the demand of BeAware, those
        court proceedings shall be discontinued by the Customer within fourteen (14) days after
        BeAware has commenced arbitration proceedings in respect of the Dispute. BeAware must
        deliver the demand for discontinuance within fourteen (14) days of service of the court
        proceedings by the Customer on BeAware and must commence the arbitration proceedings
        within thirty (30) days of delivery of the demand for discontinuance. The Customer will pay all
        costs incurred in connection with the court proceedings and the Customer will indemnify
        BeAware in respect of any costs that BeAware may be liable to pay under any order made in the
        court proceedings OR Each party will bear its own costs in connection with the court
        proceedings.</p>

      <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. By continuing to access or use our Services after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
